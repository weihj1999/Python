Take hello world as example:

import web

urls = ("/.*", "hello")
app = web.application(urls, globals())

class hello:
    def GET(self):
        return 'Hello, world!'

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()


In order to ending with or w/o '/', adding the following to the begining of 
urls:

'/(.*)/', 'redirect', 

and have the following class to handle those urls:

class redirect:
    def GET(self, path):
        web.seeother('/' + path)
